# terraform-module-kubernetes-hashicorp-vault-initialization

This Terraform module initializes and unseals vault. You can use this module to unseal vault whenever needed. This repo should be used in the context of deploying with an [admiral](https://github.com/glueops/admiral)

## Prerequisites

- Before you start have a connection to your kubernetes cluster. Make sure that you can run this command and all the vault-[0-2] pods with status "Running":
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -n glueops-core-vault
```

**Before you can use the module you need to establish a connection to the svc/vault**

- In a separate terminal on the same VM run:

```bash
kubectl -n glueops-core-vault port-forward svc/vault-ui 8200:8200
```

### Note

If you are using a self-signed SSL you need to let the vault SDK know to skip SSL verification. `export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true`
