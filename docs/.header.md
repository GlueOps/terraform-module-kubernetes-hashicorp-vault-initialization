# terraform-module-kubernetes-hashicorp-vault-initialization

This Terraform module initializes and unseals vault. You can use this module to unseal vault whenever needed. This repo should be used in the context of deploying with an [admiral](https://github.com/glueops/admiral)

## Prequisites

- Before you start have a connection to your kubernetes cluster. Make sure that you can run this command and all the vault-[0-2] pods with status "Running":
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -n glueops-core-vault
```

- This module takes no inputs and assumes that you are using vault with SSL enabled.

- Since we assumg the SSL enabled on Vault is using a self-signed cert then you will need to grab the CA:

```bash
kubectl get secret/vault-ca-secret -n glueops-core-vault --template '{{index .data "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode > ca.crt
```

- Setting this environment variable tells your system as well as golang (since it uses your system trust store) to trust your self-signed certificate:
  
`export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(pwd)/ca.crt`

**Before you can use the module you need to establish a connection to the svc/vault**

- In a separate terminal on the same VM run:

```bash
kubectl -n glueops-core-vault port-forward svc/vault-ui 8200:8200
```
